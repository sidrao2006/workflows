# Requirements:
# - Add 'jobs.<job_id>.concurrency' to caller workflows with 'cancel-in-progress' set to true.
# concurrency:
#   group: Release to Pub
#   cancel-in-progress: true
#
# - Enable 'write' permission for 'contents' and 'id-token'
# permissions:
#   contents: write
#   id-token: write
#
# Additional setup: The changelog for Github Release is generated from the CHANGELOG.md file.
# To add more details, refer to https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes#configuring-automatically-generated-release-notes
